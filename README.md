# Fetch CSV

Google Datastudio is not natively able to pull CSV.
There is some available code [here](https://github.com/googledatastudio/community-connectors/tree/master/fetch-csv), on the community connectors.

**My version correct some missing features :**

 - Fields order (breaking bug, if fields are requested in the wrong order)
 - Basic Authorization feature 

The code is entirely based on there, I have no licence on it.
